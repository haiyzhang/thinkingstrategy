# thinkingstrategy
A collection of observations and thoughts on firm strategies.

## Motivation
When I decided to spend five years to academically train myself into a strategist, I was compelled by two primarily intellectual reasons (there are other practical reasons too): One, I feel the itch caused by my own curiosity. What I saw at McKinsey was interesting, the problem is that I almost wanted to spend more time on the problems than what clients are willing / can afford to pay. Two is the recognition that the strategic management academia is perhaps one of the most connected to practice. 

Now that I am in my fourth year of the journey, I feel like I am fulfilling the first intellectual pursuit but I am failing the latter--a failure squarely lies with me--I was bogged down my paper writing (which is necessary), I got farther away from the field. I remember in my IO class, Ariel Pakes asked the class how many read the WSJ or FT. I did not see many hands up. There might have been one or two. Ariel joked that IO is perhaps a field that is closest to industry yet the best trained have yet caught on to pay attention to industry happenings. This is how I feel.
