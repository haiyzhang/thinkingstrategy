When I decided to pursue doctoral training in strategy, I was compelled by two intellectual reasons--aside from the practical considerations that accompany major life choices.

The first was curiosity. During my time at McKinsey, I found the problems fascinating. The real challenge wasn’t lack of interest; if anything, it was the opposite. I often wanted to spend more time on the problems than what clients are willing / can afford to pay. The academic path offered a way to indulge that curiosity.

The second was the recognition that the strategic management academia is perhaps one of the most connected to practice. Strategy seemed like a natual home for someone who wanted to think deeply about problems that matter in the real world.

Now that I am in my fourth year of the journey, I feel like I am fulfilling the first intellectual pursuit but I've fallen short of the second. That shortcoming is on me. I became absorbed by paper writing (which has been necessary and fulfilling), and I got farther away from the field itself.

I recall a moment in my IO class, Ariel Pakes asked the class how many read the WSJ or FT. He saw almost no hands going up. Ariel joked that IO is perhaps a field that is closest to industry yet its best-trained students rarely pay attention to industry happenings. That comment stayed with me. This is how I feel about my own driftaway.

This repository is my attempt to reconnect-—to practice noticing again, to think out loud about strategy as it unfolds in the world.
