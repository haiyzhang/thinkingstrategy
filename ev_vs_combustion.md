`When industries are stable and modular, advantage accrues to firms that excel at incremental improvement, process optimization, and cumulative learning. History compounds.`

`When industries undergo architectural shifts—where performance depends on tightly integrated systems rather than individual components—those same advantages can rapidly depreciate. Learning curves reset, incumbency weakens, and late entrants gain room to compete.`


What caught my eye was WSJ reporting about a new form of tourism in China--touring factory floors.

This is not a new phenomenon. I remember touring the Boeing facilities in Seatle and Totoya plants in Nagoya as showcases of the engineering prowess of the manufacturers. There is something deeply aesthetic about craftsmanship at industrial scale: steel and aluminum arranged into working systems. 

What struck me is how quickly China has accumulated such capabilities across industries. Solar panels, smartphones, electric vehicles, and soon, perhaps, commercial aircrafts through COMAC.

The industries in which China has caught up and surpassed incumbents appear to share a common feature: they are undergoing architectural transformations in how products are designed and produced: A phone is still called a phone. A car is still sold as a car. But a flip phone is not quite the same product as a smartphone, and a combustion-engine vehicle is not quite the same product as an EV, despite sharing labels, markets, and consumers.

One consumer-facing lens through which this difference becomes visible is repairability. When I first started using an iPhone and it broken, Apple's resolution was rarely fixing the broken parts. It would just replace the entrie device under warranty. I think the notority of how expensive to fix a Tesla (which insurance companies have priced into premiums) follows the same underlying logic. 

Why the difference in repairability? Only a naive person would think this is due to the generousity of Apple Inc. It seems to me that the integerity of the machine that makes these products execel. These products derive their performance from system-level integrity, not from the excellence of isolated components. Once that integrity is compromised, disassembly is costly enough that replacement dominates repair. This is different from twentieth-century manufacturing wisdom, where products—from flip phones to combustion-engine vehicles—were designed to be modular, repairable, and incrementally improvable over long time horizons.

Now back to the quesiton why Chinese manufacturerers can catch up with and surpass incumbents quickly: 
- First, smartphones and EVs are new products masquerading as old categories. This weakens incumbents’ accumulated advantages and compresses the effective learning horizon. 
- Second, when system integrity dominates value creation, the locus of advantage shifts from optimizing individual modules to orchestrating tightly coupled systems. Chinese manufacturing excels at large-scale integration, rapid recombination, and customization—especially when firms can source best-in-class components globally. In such settings, architectural coordination matters more than owning every underlying technology.
- Third, the knowledge accumulation process itself differs. Combustion engines reward slow, cumulative learning over decades, often centuries. Progress requires massive scale over long periods to observe rare failures and refine tolerances. By contrast, smartphones and EVs are closer to an assembly and integration game. Firms can learn quickly through iteration, supplier substitution, and software-driven updates. Learning curves are steeper but also shorter. In fact, I'd argue that incumbents are not just constrained by what they know, but by what they must unlearn. New architectures punish organizational memory. Late entrants, paradoxically, may benefit from having less to forget.
- A fourth factor may lie on the demand side. Chinese consumers appear more tolerant of rapid iteration, imperfect early versions, and frequent model turnover. This reduces the penalty for learning in public and accelerates feedback loops.
- Finally, to the point about software, software increasingly substitutes for organizational coordination. When performance improvements can be pushed via code rather than mechanical redesign, the advantage of long-established routines diminishes.

Obviously, confounding factors abound. China’s industrial policy like subsidies, protected domestic markets, coordinated infrastructure investment can explain part of the observed speed of catch-up, and any serious account would be incomplete without it. But industrial policy alone cannot explain the pattern of catch-up. China has not advanced equally quickly across all complex manufacturing industries. Progress has been fastest in sectors undergoing architectural change, where products are being redefined and learning curves are being reset.

A further factor is the structure of China’s domestic market itself. Large, dense, and heterogeneous demand allows firms to experiment at scale, iterate rapidly, and fail cheaply. When early mistakes can be absorbed by sheer volume, firms can move down learning curves far faster than competitors operating in smaller or more fragmented markets.
