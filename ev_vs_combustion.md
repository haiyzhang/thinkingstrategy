What caught my eye was WSJ reporting about a new form of tourism in China--touring factory floors. 

This is not a new phenomenon. I remember touring the Boeing facilities in Seatle and Totoya plants in Nagoya as showcases of the engineering prowess of the manufacturers. There is something deeply aesthetic about craftsmanship at industrial scale: steel and aluminum arranged into working systems. 

What struck me is how quickly China has accumulated such showcases across industries. Solar panels, smartphones, electric vehicles, and soon, perhaps, commercial aircrafts through COMAC.

The industries in which China has caught up and surpassed incumbents appear to share a common feature: they are undergoing architectural transformations in how products are designed and produced: A phone is still called a phone. A car is still called a car. But a flip phone is not quite the same product as a smartphone, and a combustion-engine vehicle is not quite the same product as an EV, despite sharing labels, markets, and consumers.

One consumer-facing lens through which this difference becomes visible is repairability. When I first started using iPhone, I was most impressed not by its functionality but how different repair process unfolds--basically when my iPhone was broken, likely Apple would just replace it with a new one if under warranty. Only a naive person would think this is due to the generousity of Apple Inc. I think the notority of how expenseive to fix Tesla (which insurance companies are well aware and price into premium) is the same underlying logic. 

It is the integerity of the machine that makes these products execel. If fixing such a machine requires teraring apart the system, it might as well replace the whole set. This is different from a flip phone or a  combustine engine car which is produced following the modular wisdom of twentith century manufacturing. 

Now back to the quesiton why China can catch up quickly: 
- First, smartphones and EVs are new products masquerading as old categories. This weakens incumbents’ accumulated advantages and compresses the effective learning horizon. 
- Second, when system integrity dominates value creation, the locus of advantage shifts from optimizing individual modules to orchestrating tightly coupled systems. Chinese manufacturing excels at large-scale integration, rapid recombination, and customization—especially when firms can source best-in-class components globally. In such settings, architectural coordination matters more than owning every underlying technology.
Third, the knowledge accumulation process itself differs. Combustion engines reward slow, cumulative learning over decades, often centuries. Progress requires massive scale over long periods to observe rare failures and refine tolerances. By contrast, smartphones and EVs are closer to an assembly and integration game. Firms can learn quickly through iteration, supplier substitution, and software-driven updates. Learning curves are steeper—but also shorter.

obviously confoudnign factors exist. Chian's industrial policy would help explain away parts of the observed catch-up speed. So is the perhaps (add another factor)
